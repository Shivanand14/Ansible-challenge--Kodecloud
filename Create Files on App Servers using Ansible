The Nautilus DevOps team is testing various Ansible modules on servers in Stratos DC. They're currently focusing on file creation on remote hosts using Ansible. Here are the details:


a. Create an inventory file ~/playbook/inventory on jump host and include all app servers.


b. Create a playbook ~/playbook/playbook.yml to create a blank file /opt/nfsshare.txt on all app servers.


c. Set the permissions of the /opt/nfsshare.txt file to 0755.


d. Ensure the user/group owner of the /opt/nfsshare.txt file is tony on app server 1, steve on app server 2 and banner on app server 3.


Note: Validation will execute the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml, so ensure the playbook functions correctly without any additional arguments.

Solution to create in entory file:
vi inventory

[app_servers]
stapp01 ansible_user=tony ansible_password=Ir0nM@n ansible_connection=ssh
stapp02 ansible_user=steve ansible_password=Am3ric@ ansible_connection=ssh
stapp03 ansible_user=banner ansible_password=BigGr33n ansible_connection=ssh

To create playbook.yml file

playbook.yml:

- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Create empty file
    file:
      path: /tmp/app.txt
      state: touch
      owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
      group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
      mode: "0755"

After creating the inventory & app file. run below command for validation of playbook is functioning correctly.

ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
